# School_District_Analysis
Module 4
## Overview of the school district analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to use Python and Jupyter Notebook and code that we had already created to conduct an analysis on schools within a school district. We analyzed the highest and lowest performing schools within the district, the budget per student, and the math and reading grades of students. Once we ran through our code we created during the module, we started on the particular purpose of this challenge assignment. We wanted to see if there were signs of academic dishonesty, so we went to Thomas High School and exchanged the 9th grade reading and math scores for NaNs. Then we redid our analysis using these NaNs. 

## Results
Because the school board was concerned about Thomas High School and the scores of their 9th grade students, we conducted a test. We replaced the 9th grade math and reading scores with NaNs and redid the analysis. 
Here are the original results:

As you can see, Thomas High School had an overall passing rate of 90% which was of concern to the school board. 

And here is the redone analysis:

As you can see, it significantly changed the overall passing % of Thomas High School.Thomas High School went from being the 2nd highest rated school in the district to 8th. 

In our first analysis, Thomas High School had a reading average score and a math average score of about 83. In our new analysis, you can see what replacing the NaNs to 9th grade did here:

Thomas High School was in the $630-644 bin for spending. We did not see that change in the adjusted analysis.
